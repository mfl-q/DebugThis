# Intentionally Broken Web Stack

Should be started with `docker compose up`

Expected behavior:

* accessible on http://localhost:8000
* nginx proxying requests to the flask backend
* default page should show a visited X times counter
* redis is used by the flask application to persist the counter

Please help us to get this fixed, it seems broken on multiple levels :-)
